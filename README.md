# 8puter

This is a Homebrew 8-bit computer project, using mostly simple modern parts.
Based on the legendary MOS6502 processor, we are using the modern CMOS version made by WDC. Basically an exercise in computer architechture design. I plan to get this manufactured into a PCB and assemble myself into a working computer. 

I've made the schematic by using a few ideas from other people's projects on this forum and also from youtube videos like Ben Eater's and George Foot's videos.

I'm looking for some reviews/sanity checks from people who have done this sort of thing before.  

**Main Parts**  

uProcessor: W65C02S  
ROM and RAM: AT28C256 and AS6C62256, both 32K  
VIA: W65C22  
USB I/f: FT245RL  
Video: STM32F301 uController

### Preview

Here is a picture of a 3D model of the completed PCB.

Once I verify and get this manufactured, there will be a real image.

## My Goals

The main thing I want to be able to do with this SBC is to program it with itself. This means having some way to input text from a keyboard and display it to some kind of screen/output device, and I've chosen a VGA monitor for this. I'm not trying to keep this compatible with the ROMs/BIOSs or code of old but I want to be able to write my own, preferably on the machine itself. 
Also, I dont want to use discrete logic for everything since I have some experience with trying to make that work. I'm also not necessarily using all DIP chips because of lack space, and going SMD isnt that much of a problem.

To store programs on a sort of "disk", I thought I need to add some sort of serial interface which can talk to a microSD card, such that the computer can use it as storage. This is accomplished via SPI. 
The peripheral interface talks to a USB controller and *should* be able to use a USB keyboard as input device. This idea was taken from the schematic of the [SBC dev board that WDC sells](https://wdc65xx.com/Single-Board-Computers/w65c02sxb/).

The video signal is being generated by a microcontroller (STM32) because I thought that's probably the easiest way to get it working without worrying about a lot of VGA signal timing. This MCU is fast enough to generate a 640x480 screen and has enough memory to store the framebuffer and its the only *cheat* I've used. Some more details are in my schematic.
