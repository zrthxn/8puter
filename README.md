# 8puter

Homebrew 8-bit computer project, using modern parts. **Work in Progress.**
Based on the legendary MOS6502 processor, using the modern CMOS version made by WDC. Basically an exercise in computer architechture design.

### Preview

Here is a picture of a 3D model of the completed PCB.

Once I verify and get this manufactured, there will be a real image.

### Resources

Some great resources I found for this project, including those from people who have done this sort of thing before.

- [WDC's own SBC board schematic](https://wdc65xx.com/Single-Board-Computers/w65c02sxb/)
- [6052 Primer](http://wilsonminesco.com/6502primer) on how to get started building your own, especially the [address decode](http://wilsonminesco.com/6502primer/addr_decoding.html) section
- [6502.org: Homebuilt Projects](http://www.6502.org/homebuilt)
- [This guy's breadboard computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdFXc0Rkpvc&list=PLdGm_pyUmoII9D16mzw-XsJjHKi3f1kqT) which is actually based on the (later) 65816 processor, but has some great ideas.
