# 8puter

This is a Homebrew 8-bit computer project, using mostly simple modern parts.
Based on the legendary MOS6502 processor, we are using the modern CMOS version made by WDC. Basically an exercise in computer architechture. I plan to get this manufactured into a PCB and assemble myself into a working computer. 

Please feel free to leave reviews/sanity checks from people who have done this sort of thing before, or know something about this, in the [issues](/issues).  

## Preview

Here is a picture of a 3D model of the completed PCB.

## My Goals

The main thing I want to be able to do with this SBC is to program it with itself. This means having some way to input text from a keyboard and display it to some kind of screen/output device, and I've chosen a VGA monitor for this. I'm not trying to keep this compatible with the ROMs/BIOSs or code of old but I want to be able to write my own, preferably on the machine itself. 
Also, I dont want to use discrete logic for everything since I have some experience with trying to make that work. I'm also not necessarily using all DIP chips because of lack space, and going SMD isnt that much of a problem.

To store programs on a sort of "disk", I thought I need to add some sort of serial interface which can talk to a microSD card, such that the computer can use it as storage. This is accomplished via SPI. 
The peripheral interface talks to a USB controller and *should* be able to use a USB keyboard as input device. This idea was taken from the schematic of the [SBC dev board that WDC sells](https://wdc65xx.com/Single-Board-Computers/w65c02sxb/).

The video signal is being generated by a microcontroller because I thought that's probably the easiest way to get it working without worrying about a lot of VGA signal timing. This MCU is fast enough to generate a 640x480 screen and has enough memory to store the framebuffer and its the only *cheat* I've used. Some more details are in my schematic
